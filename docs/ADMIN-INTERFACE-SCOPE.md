# HOPE Theater Seating - Admin Interface Development Scope

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Replace the problematic seat initializer system with a robust, user-friendly admin interface for managing seat pricing configurations.

**Background**: The current system relies on hardcoded seat configurations and dangerous regeneration buttons that have historically corrupted seating data. We need a visual, intuitive interface that eliminates the need for the initializer entirely.

## Current State

### âœ… Completed (Phase 1)
- Production seat map fixed with correct pricing tiers
- Seat initializer disabled with safety checks  
- Database backup of correct pricing assignments created
- Documentation of seating data pipeline completed
- Version 2.3.4 deployed to production

### ðŸŽ¯ Target State (Phase 2)
- Visual seat map editor with click-to-change pricing
- Complete pricing map management system
- Bulk operations for efficient seat configuration
- Import/export capabilities for backup/restore
- No dependency on hardcoded initializer data

## Phase 2 Scope: Admin Interface Development

### 1. Core Admin Interface Structure

#### 1.1 Menu Organization
```
HOPE Seating (Main Menu)
â”œâ”€â”€ Dashboard (overview, statistics)
â”œâ”€â”€ Pricing Maps (create, manage, clone maps)
â”œâ”€â”€ Seat Editor (visual seat map with pricing editor)
â”œâ”€â”€ Import/Export (backup and restore configurations)
â””â”€â”€ Diagnostics (current functionality preserved)
```

#### 1.2 User Experience Requirements
- **Intuitive**: Click-based seat editing (no SQL knowledge required)
- **Visual**: Real-time seat map with color-coded pricing tiers
- **Safe**: Built-in validation and confirmation dialogs
- **Efficient**: Bulk operations for mass changes
- **Reliable**: Undo functionality and backup integration

### 2. Feature Specifications

# CSV Format
section,row,seat,pricing_tier,price
A,1,1,P1,50.00
A,1,2,P1,50.00
```

```json
{
  "pricing_map": {
    "name": "Standard Pricing",
    "seats": [
      {"seat_id": "A1-1", "tier": "P1", "price": 50.00},
      {"seat_id": "A1-2", "tier": "P1", "price": 50.00}
    ]
  }
}
```

#### 2.5 Accessibility Features â™¿
**Priority**: HIGH - Legal compliance and user experience

**Features:**
- AA seat confirmation popup with accessibility notice
- Clear explanation that AA seats are reserved for mobility assistance
- Option to proceed or select different seats
- ADA compliance messaging and disclaimers

**Popup Message:**
```
"Accessible Seating Notice

These seats are specifically reserved for patrons with mobility 
challenges, wheelchair users, and their companions. 

Are you selecting these seats because you or someone in your 
party requires accessible seating?

[Yes, we need accessible seating] [No, select different seats]"
```

#### 2.6 Advanced Features ðŸ”§
**Priority**: LOW - Nice-to-have enhancements

**Features:**
- Pricing tier templates (save common patterns)
- Price adjustment tools (increase all P1 by 10%)
- Seat availability overlay (show booked seats)
- Change history log with rollback capability
- Multi-theater support (if expanded beyond HOPE)

### 3. Technical Architecture

#### 3.1 Database Schema (No Changes Required)
- Existing separated architecture is perfect
- `wp_hope_seating_physical_seats` (physical layout)
- `wp_hope_seating_pricing_maps` (pricing configurations) 
- `wp_hope_seating_seat_pricing` (seat â†’ tier assignments)

#### 3.2 New PHP Classes Required

```php
// Core admin interface
class HOPE_Seating_Admin_Interface {
    // Visual seat map editor
    // Pricing map CRUD operations
    // Bulk operations handler
}

// Import/export functionality  
class HOPE_Seating_Import_Export {
    // CSV/JSON import/export
    // Validation and error handling
    // Backup/restore operations
}

// AJAX handlers for real-time updates
class HOPE_Seating_Admin_Ajax {
    // Seat pricing updates
    // Bulk operations
    // Map management
}
```

#### 3.3 Frontend Technologies
- **JavaScript**: ES6+ with async/await for AJAX
- **CSS**: Modern flexbox/grid for responsive layout
- **SVG**: Interactive seat map with click handlers
- **AJAX**: Real-time updates without page refreshes
