# HOPE Theater Seating POS Integration - Design Notes

## Project Overview
Add-on plugin to integrate HOPE Theater Seating with FooEventsPOS, enabling visual seat selection in the Point of Sale interface.

## Architecture Decision
**Separate Add-on Plugin** (hope-theater-seating-pos)
- Clean separation from core seating functionality
- Optional dependency - no unused code for non-POS users
- Independent update cycles reduce upgrade risks
- Easier testing and maintenance

## Dependencies
- HOPE Theater Seating (core plugin)
- FooEvents POS Plugin
- WordPress + WooCommerce

## Technical Approach - Option 1: Enhance Existing POS UI

### Integration Points
1. **Product Detection**: Detect when theater seating products are added to POS cart
2. **Variation Override**: Replace standard variation dropdown with seat selection interface
3. **Visual Selection**: Reuse core plugin's seat map rendering in React environment
4. **Session Management**: Integrate with existing seat hold/availability system

### REST API Extensions
New endpoints to add to FooEventsPOS:
```
/wp-json/fooeventspos/v1/seat-maps/{event_id}
/wp-json/fooeventspos/v1/seat-availability/{event_id}
/wp-json/fooeventspos/v1/seat-hold
/wp-json/fooeventspos/v1/seat-release
```

### React Component Integration
- Seat selection modal/component for POS interface
- Touch-friendly interface for customer interaction
- Integration with existing cart/order workflow
- Real-time availability updates

### Customer-Facing Considerations
- Larger touch targets for finger selection
- Clear visual feedback for seat status (available/taken/selected)
- Simple navigation (zoom, pan for large venues)
- Accessible color scheme and text sizing
- POS interface rotation capability for customer-facing interaction

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Plugin Foundation
- Create plugin skeleton with dependency checks
- Set up build system for React components
- Establish communication with core seating plugin

### Phase 2: REST API Integration
- Extend FooEventsPOS REST API with seat-specific endpoints
- Adapt core plugin's AJAX handlers for REST consumption
- Implement seat holding/availability checking

### Phase 3: React Components
- Create seat selection modal component
- Integrate with existing POS variation selection workflow
- Implement touch-friendly seat map interface

### Phase 4: Customer Experience
- Optimize interface for customer-facing interaction
- Add accessibility features
- Performance optimization for large venue maps

### Phase 5: Testing & Polish
- Cross-browser testing
- Integration testing with various event configurations
- User acceptance testing with actual POS workflow

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Lazy load seat maps only when needed
- Optimize React components for touch devices
- Efficient seat availability checking

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if dependencies unavailable
- Clear error messages for version conflicts
- Fallback to standard variation selection if seat selection fails

### Security
- Proper nonce verification for REST endpoints
- Validate seat selections against actual availability
- Prevent seat manipulation through client-side modifications

## Development Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1**: 1 week (plugin foundation)
- **Phase 2**: 1-2 weeks (REST API integration)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 weeks (React components)
- **Phase 4**: 1 week (customer experience optimization)
- **Phase 5**: 1 week (testing & polish)

**Total Estimate**: 6-8 weeks development time

## Future Considerations
- Multi-POS system support
- Mobile app integration possibilities
- Advanced reporting for POS seat sales
- Integration with other ticketing systems

## Notes from Analysis Session
- FooEventsPOS uses React-based architecture with WordPress REST API communication
- Existing variation selection provides good integration pattern
- Plugin stores configuration in localStorage for frontend app
- Template uses standard WordPress hooks (wp_head, wp_footer)
- Clean separation between PHP backend and React frontend
